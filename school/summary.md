## [School Data Integration and Authentication Case Study](./)

### Summary

#### [Account Creation](account_findings.html)

All products provide methods to create user accounts through manual and automated CSV uploads. All vendors except Blackboard provide an API for account creation. Clever IDM can automate the data flow from SIS to Google.

#### [End-User Authentication](authentication_findings.html)

There is a wide variety of authentication methods supported in these systems. All products offer support for a [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) based authentication service with [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) being the most often mentioned.

#### [Classroom Rostering](rostering_findings.html)

[Clever](https://clever.com/) has partnered with [Edupoint](https://edupoint.com/) to provide a syncing service from [Synergy SIS](https://edupoint.com/Products/Student-Information-Management). Clever and Google have an [automated rostering application](https://clever.com/about/news/clever-and-google-partner-to-streamline-access-to-google-classroom) for Google Classroom.  Blackboard provides their own integration services for a fee and does not seem to have any kind of partnership with Clever.
