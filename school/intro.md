## [School Data Integration and Authentication Case Study](/school/)

### Introduction

Educators face many challenges managing learning resources in today's environment. The availability and ubiquity of learning applications and systems can make overseeing them increasingly difficult. We want teachers to be teaching not dealing with login issues or hand entering roster data. It is important that a school's IT infrastructure is able to integrate data across applications and to make authentication as seamless as possible.

In this study we will research five products offered by four vendors that are commonly used by school districts. The focus will be on the available choices for end-user authentication, data integration, account creation, and classroom rostering. This review will be in the context of a medium sized suburban school district in the United States.
