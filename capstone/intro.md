## Google Data Analytics Capstone:  Case Study

### Introduction

I choose a track 2 case study which involves formulating your own scenario. I was inspired by the discovery of a used car dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data). My study revolves around a fictional regional car repair business, **Acme Auto**, located in Oregon, USA.  The company faces a challenging business environment caused by a downturn in travel caused by a worldwide pandemic.
