### Additional Deliverables and Findings

Some areas of interest that are outside of the scope of this analysis were discovered.

* Temporal analysis would be helpful to see what kind of seasonal trends exist.  We only had sales posting data for one month and Acme has not historical data in this market space. Search engine analytics might offer insights.  We did analyze the posting data we had looking for day of the week patterns which you can see on this [visualization](visuals/day.html).

* A breakeven analysis to determine the number of units that would need to be sold to profit from the new venture is essential but outside our scope.

* No attempt was made develop a means to predict or evaluate the price of an individual vehicle. By looking at the Ford F150 visualization we can see that there are some vehicles that are both below average price and below average mileage.
