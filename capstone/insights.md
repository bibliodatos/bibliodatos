### Key Insights


Not all local car markets in Oregon are created equal.  Deschutes and Lane county stand out. There is wide disparity between locations so a data driven approach to choosing a target test market is essential.

* Factors:
  - Population and car registration growth - [2% to 17%](growth_table.html)
  - Climate affects vehicle condition and average annual rainfall is widely different - [12 to  89 inches](precip_table.html)
  - Availability of inventory for purchase and distance to market - [0 to ~1700 posts](posting_table.html) per month
  - [Competition](comp_table.html)

Acme's plan to flip cars in need of repair is viable. Moving up the condition scale 1/2 of a grade, for example high 'Excellent' to 'Like New', could see a gross increase of $4000-$5000. There is profit to be made by intelligently targeting cars with higher upside potential and managing costs.
