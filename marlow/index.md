![History of Marlow cover picture](marlow_cover.png)

Many years ago I was researching my family history and I determined that my 5th great grandfather spent some years living in a small town named Marlow in Cheshire county New Hampshire. At that point in my research he was the farthest back I had been able to trace my direct paternal line.  This man, Benajah Maynard, was a bit of a brickwall in my research.  I learned of a local history of Marlow compiled by Elgin Jones prior to his death in 1934 and reedited by the Marlow Historical Society in 2002. I quickly ordered a copy of the book and eagerly waited the delivery.  The book, while a treasure trove of information for my research, did not contain an index with which I could quickly lookup the relavant pages for persons of interest to me. I considered the work it would take to read each page carefully scanning for potential family names as I went. I eventually decided to scan the pages and use OCR software to create my own personal electronic text verson.  I accomplished the scan and was able to do a text search for my Maynards.  To me delight I found a note in the text indicating that a Jabez/Jabes Maynard was Benajah's father.  Just the breakthrough I needed for my research.

My personal text copy of the History of Marlow, New Hampshire sat unused for years.  As I continued in my professional career in software engineering and in my personal hobby as a family history researcher I often thought about how much data might be hidden from other researchers in these kind of historical records.  Often written as a labor of love to a local community but without the resources to create a helpful index or any metadata that would assist would be investigators. Finally, one day as I determined to brush up on a new programming language (Python),  I decided to undertake a project to create a surname index for the book that had unlocked my family line for me.  It would be just the right level of complexity to deepen by Python skills.  I was able to write a pair of scripts to find all the proper nouns in the text and tokenizing them such that it became apparent there were patterns that could be used to help identify people, surnames, geographical places. The tokenizing script id a good job of identifying people and places but its results are not perfect. For instance, how to determine if a proper noun including Hill is a person or a geographical feature.  The script got me about 90% of the way to having something to create my indexes from but that last 10% would be very hard to accomplish programatically.  The last 10% was done by old fashined editing. A process that made me further appreciate the work done by Python already. Below you will find links to the indexes I have created.
